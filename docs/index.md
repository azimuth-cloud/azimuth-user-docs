Azimuth science platforms are powered by [Azimuth](https://github.com/azimuth-cloud/azimuth/), a self-service portal for managing cloud resources with a particular focus on simplifying the use of cloud for scientific computing, high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI).

If this is your first visit to the Azimuth portal, or you would just like to know more about how to get access to a cloud project - [get started](getting-started/getting-started.md) with Azimuth science platforms.

## Platforms
Platforms can be deployed directly from the Azimuth Platforms interface.
### [:fontawesome-solid-computer: Linux Workstation](platforms/linux-workstation.md)
A versatile Linux compute instance, which can be accessed using a web-browser.

### [:fontawesome-brands-python: Jupyter Notebook](platforms/jupyter-notebook.md)
A Jupyter notebook created from a [repo2docker-compatible](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) repository.

### [:fontawesome-solid-server: Slurm Cluster](platforms/slurm.md)
A multi-node [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) batch-compute cluster.

### [:material-kubernetes: Kubernetes](platforms/kubernetes.md)
A fully-featured [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) container orchestration cluster.

## Kubernetes Applications
Kubernetes Applications require an existing [Kubernetes cluster](platforms/kubernetes.md) before they can be deployed.
### [:fontawesome-brands-python: JupyterHub](platforms/kubernetes-applications/jupyterhub.md)
A multi-user JupyterHub on Kubernetes, powered by [zero-to-jupyterhub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### [:material-expansion-card-variant: GPU-enabled Jupyter Notebooks](platforms/kubernetes-applications/gpu-enabled-notebooks.md)
Launch a GPU-enabled Jupyter Notebook using JupyterHub.

### [:fontawesome-brands-python: DaskHub](platforms/kubernetes-applications/daskhub.md)
A multi-user DaskHub on Kubernetes. [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/) is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python.
